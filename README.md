# arduino-alarm
A temperature humidity monitoring and alarm system. When humidity reaches above 85% or any set threshold, the buzzer will beep and the current time will freeze until the system is reset.

This project was useful for experimenting digital IO and components such as the IR remote and LCD display.

This is a project for the CS 351 Computer Architecture class. View the video demonstration [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjC6v3TxkL8)
